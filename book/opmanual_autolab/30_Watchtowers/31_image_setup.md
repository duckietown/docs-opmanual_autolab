The image setup procedure for Watchtowers is the same as for Duckiebots.

In the Autolab of ETH Zurich, we use the naming convention: 

* linux-username:  **mom**
* hostname **watchtowerXX** (where XX specify the number of the Watchtower)
* password **MomWatches**.

Using the above naming conventions, you can flash your SD cards as is described in [Duckiebot Initialization](+opmanual_duckiebot#setup-duckiebot).
