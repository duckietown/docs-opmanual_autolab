# BUILDING - Watchtower in WT18 configuration {#watchtower-hardware-assembly-WT18 status=deprecated}

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: Material: Watchtower components. To obtain them contact info@duckietown.org.

Requires: An [initialized SD-card](#wt-sd-card-init).

Requires: Tools: (strong) wood glue or hot glue gun, tape, double-sided tape.

Results: An Assembled Watchtower system in WT18 configuration.

Next Steps: The next step is to [initialize the SD card](#watchtower-initialization).

## Before Assembly

### From Wooden Plates to Chasis Parts (Laser Cut):
The plates should be 4mm thick. To cut a set of traffic light, you need a plates with the size of roughly 347mm x 256mm x 4mm.


### Tubes Preparation:

We only need one tube here. The spec of the tube is listed directly below.

<col2 figure-id="tab:wt_escapes" figure-caption="Symbols to escape">
    <s>Length: </s> <s>572mm</s>
    <s>Diameter: </s> <s>20mm</s>
</col2>

We recommend you to buy a tube cutter. It'll save you from lots of troubles. After cutting the tube, you could polish the edges so that it won't hurt you.


## Watchtower Assembly

### Wooden Box (with Raspberry Pi)
These are all the parts for assembly the wooden chasis.

##### Step 1: Stick the sliders

</div>

##### Step 2: Combine two walls of the box

</div>

##### Step 3: Stick the third wall of the box

</div>

##### Step 4: Stick the forth wall of the box

  <img src="images/Step4.jpg" style='width: 25em; height:auto'/>
</div>

##### Step 5: Stick the stabler for the tube
Stick the small part, but DON'T stick the large plate. It should be the lid for the box that can be opened so that we could put Raspberry Pi in.

</div>

##### Step 6: Get the parts for camera mount

</div>

##### Step 7: Stick the stablers for tubes on camera mount
Note that there're two parts with larger holes and one part with a smaller hole. Tubes can go through lager hole but not smaller one. Thus, you should place the parts with smaller on the very top.

  <img src="images/Step7.png" style='width: 25em; height:auto'/>
</div>

##### Step 8: Stick the other side of camera mount
<div figure-id="fig:wt_step8" figure-caption="Step 8">
  <img src="images/Step8.png" style='width: 25em; height:auto'/>
</div>

##### Step 9: Stick the little T shape part on the lid of camera mount
You don't need to stick the lid on the camera.

</div>

##### Step 10: Parts you need for Raspberry PI holder.
Including the plate, two M2.5, 12mm Spacers, two M2.5, 6mm Screws, two M2.5, 4mm Screws and one Raspberry PI 3B+ Model.

  <img src="images/Step10.jpg" style='width: 25em; height:auto'/>
</div>

##### Step 11: Install the spacers with the 6mm screws.
<div figure-id="fig:wt_step11" figure-caption="Step 11">
  <img src="images/Step11.jpg" style='width: 25em; height:auto'/>
</div>

##### Step 12: Install the RPI with the 4mm screws.

  <img src="images/Step12.jpg" style='width: 25em; height:auto'/>
</div>

After this step, we're finished with the chassis. Now let's assemble everything.

##### Step 13: Put tubes through the chassis.

##### Step 14: Install camera mount on the very top of the tube.

##### Step 15: Install the camera cables on Raspberry PI and let it go through the tube.

##### Step 16: Install camera on the other side of the cable and put it on the camera mount.

##### Step 17: Final Results
You finished the assembly! You can now prettify the tube according to your own taste. The final result should look like [](#fig:WT18_final).
