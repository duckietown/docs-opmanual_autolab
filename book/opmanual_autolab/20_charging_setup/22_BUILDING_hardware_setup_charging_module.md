# Charging module {#autocharging-charging-module status=beta}

For the construction of a charging module, you have many degrees of freedom. This includes the choice of material of the wooden structure (may be metal as well), the type of connection between the structure elements (screws, glue, nails), the length of the cables and many more.

However, the following requirements need to be satisfied:

* Insulators need to be mounted $210mm$ above tiles ([](#fig:hv_pole_drawing)) for optimal pressure between current collector and charging rails
* Insulators need to be centered with respect to a lane to obtain good contact in center of lane
* There must be at least $150mm$ in between the white lines and the pylons to provide enough space to drive in a lane
* Enough high voltge poles (one per tile) must be used to provide a stable charger

In the following, you find the description on how we did it in Zurich.

## Building a charging module


### Assemble the wooden structure

Assemble the wooden structure as in [](#fig:assembled_wooden_struc). This part may differ from our reference part. The important and neccessary specifications are: (i) the structure must be larger than one tile such that a road (with margins on both sides) may fit underneath and (ii) the space between the tile and the bottom part of the crossbar must be exactly 21cm (see [](#fig:hv_pole_drawing)).

### Prepare for mounting the insulators

Make sure you have the parts ready seen in [](#fig:assembly_hv_pole).

### Drill the holes

Drill 3mm holes such that the insulators will be centered after mounting, seen in [](#fig:hv_pole_drawing)

The 6mm holes (depth roughly 5mm) are optional and act as a hideout for the screw heads. The resulting holes should look like [](#fig:drilling_hole_hv_pole).

### Fix the high voltage poles to tiles

Use double-sided tape to mount the high voltage poles to the tiles ([](#fig:glued_wooden_structure)). Make sure that the high voltage poles are aligned throughout the whole charging module.

\emph{Optional}: you could also use hot glue instead of double-sided tape.


### Bend brass rails and mount them

Bend the charging rails 5cm on both sides (in the same direction) to ensure that Duckiebots do not get stuck when arriving at the charging rail tiles ([](#fig:glued_wooden_structure)).

Then, clip the brass rails into the insulators.

### Solder laboratory plugs

Strip the insulation of the four red and four black cables on both sides with a wire stripper off. Then solder four red and four black cables each to a laboratory plug as seen in [](#fig:soldered_plugs). These cables should be approximately 20-25cm long.

<div figure-id="fig:soldered_plugs">
<img src="images/soldered_plugs.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>

### Attach cable shoes
In order to crimp a cable shoe onto a cable, you need the following things which you can see in [](#fig:crimping_tools).

<div figure-id="fig:crimping_tools">
<img src="images/crimping.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>
<figcaption>

First put the cable shoe onto the uninsulated cable such that it looks as in [](#fig:attached_crimped_cable). Then take the crimping tool, put the cable inside the yellow hole and press the cable shoe on it.

<img src="images/crimped_cable.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>
<figcaption>

### Connect the cable to the power supply
Mount a cable shoe $Ø4-6mm²$ with a crimping tool on the other side of these cables you have soldered. Then connect two red and two black cables respectively together with another cable shoe with a M4 screw and a M4 nut as seen in [](#fig:connected_cables). Then connect to the third cable shoe the corresponding red/black cable which will go towards the power supply. This third cable should be long enough to reach the power supply. Also attach to the end of the third cable a cable shoe.

### Plug the soldered laboratory plug cable to the brass rail
 Connect the laboratory plugs to the bended ends of the charging rails as seen in [](#fig:mounted_plugs). The cables of the brass rods must be polarized as seen in [](#fig:polarity_graph). Make sure that you connect the four rods on the left to one power supply and another four rods on the right to the other power supply.

### Prepare the power cable for the power supply
Take the power cable [](#fig:pow_kabel) and strip the isolation off. Then attach a cable-end-sleeve with the crimping tool as seen in [](#fig:power_cable). Then connect the prepared cable to the power supply exactly as it is shown in [](#fig:attached_power_cable).

Note:
**It is important that ground, phase and neutral phase is connected the right way, so the colors need to match**.

### Attach to power source
Connect the power supply to the rails. Red cable to V+ and black cable to V- as shown in [](#fig:powersupply). Make also a connection between the two power supplies ground, in order to have a common ground.

<div figure-id="fig:powersupply">
<img src="images/powersupply_attach.jpg" style="width: 80%"/>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</div>

### Adjust the output voltage of the power source
Turn on the power supply by plugging in the power cable. There is a voltage regulator - the plastic screw - (see [](#fig:powersupply)) next to the V+ connection - there you can adjust the voltage. Take a screw driver and a multimeter and measure the Voltage across V+ and V-. The Voltage should be adjusted to 5.5V.

### Test your setup

Place an assemblied Duckiebot [](#fig:result_cc) which is capable of charging underneath the charging rails, turn on the power supplies and see if the battery is going to charge.
