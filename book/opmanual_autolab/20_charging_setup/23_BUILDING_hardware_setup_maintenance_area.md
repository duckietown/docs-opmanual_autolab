# Building a maintenance area {#autocharging-maintenance-area status=beta}

<div figure-id="fig:maintenance-area">

Next, please build the whole maintenance area.

## Put together all tiles

Respect the constraints of Duckietown.

## Add April tags for every intersection

**Note down** all the **tag IDs** and their **positions** in your maintenance area - you will need them later on to define your map in the software.

## Add a red line and a **STOP** april tag after each charger

Directly at the beginning of the next tile after a charger, add a red line [](#fig:red_line). This red line and the stop tag is used to determine whether a Duckiebot is the first in a charger or not.  

## Place a traffic light on the maintenance intersection 

This traffic light will serve as the charging manager.

## Place watchtowers on charger intersections
Make sure that the intersection is under the scope of the camera
