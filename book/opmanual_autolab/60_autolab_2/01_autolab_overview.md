## Definition

The goal of an Autolab is to create a automated environment for Duckiebots, in which their behaviors can be evaluated.

### More specifically:

- If identical(*) hardware and software is used on 2 Duckiebots, the behavior should be reproducible in the same environment.
- the environment should be highly controlled and configurable

(*) identical to the best knowledge

### Applications:

- research benchmarking with the Duckietown platform
- physical evaluations for challenges of [AIDO](+AIDO#book)
